      <h2>Benefit of Responsive Web Design</h2>
      <p>Responsive web design reacts on the size of a user's screen. It will resize the website based on the device's screen size automatically, which is more flexible. The population of using mobile devices is growing. The device users can have better user experience for responsive web design. They can access the website easier, which can increase the number of usage of tablet or mobile users of accessing the website. If the website is not resizing and the content would be distorted, which is hard for them to read. It does not have standardization of devices' size. If the standard size is changed, the website can still be viewable. The users would rather go to different websites. When more people are visiting your site, you can increase the sale. Another benefit of responsive web design is that the web development team does not need to create another version of website for mobile users, which can keep the style of the web consistent and save time and money to maintain two separate websites.</p>
